                    <p>Probably the most underdeveloped thing that I have. I had an idea to make a world to work with for things such as Dungeons and Dragons, but I never really finished the world map.</p>

                    <p>I think I had a name for this continent, but if I did... I forgot it. This takes place in a world separate from the one I made a map for. The theme for this region was that, thousands of years ago, a ruler was given divine power from the gods. This divine power was passed from parent to first born child for generations, until one generation's "first born child" happened to be a pair of twins. The divine power was split between the twins, and when they came of age, a struggle for power between the two of them arose. The twins rallied armies against each other, and in an event known to historians as the Split-Kingdom war, the region itself was nearly torn to pieces. Local historians aren't clear as to how or why the war came to an end, all they know is that it did, and the twin rulers agreed to go their separate ways, each establishing a kingdom on opposite sides of a ravine carved from the war they started.</p>

                    <h2>Ignom, My Not-So-Human DnD Character</h2>
                    <img class="rykerPhoto" id="ignom" src="Personal Website (Ryker)\Ignom.png" />
                    <p id="artLabel">Art was made by my fantastic fiancé</p>
                    <p>Ignom is a character for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign hosted by Cameron. Having grown up in Icewind Dale, he started out as a kind of navigator for the group, because even a rough idea of the layout of the Ten Towns is better than no idea at all. The ancient fire elemental from Hell giving him magical darkvision is a bonus when the sun is rarely visible as well. Countless conversations with this entity living in his mind led to the discovery that he wasn't entirely human, rather a kind of partial elemental that's immune to the cold (as well as a plethora of other fire-based biological abilities that I rarely get to use). After a series of events that he more or less caused led to the death of a party member, Ignom has felt lost, searching for means to atone for his mistakes.</p>
                    <p>I am... far better at making characters than worlds in my opinion.</p>
