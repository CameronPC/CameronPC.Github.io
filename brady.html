                        The Interior Body (also know as: The Interior) is used to define those within the main assembly of politics in the City of Light.
                        Simple paper workers and bureaucrats that keep the system flowing from a legal standpoint.
                        They are also referred to as: "The Autarch's Left Hand".

                            They are messengers responsible for relaying information across the city.
                            They are also used as intermediaries between the Interior Body, the Magistry, and Noble Houses.

                            There are twenty Prime Overseers in the city at any given time.
                            Prime Overseers report directly to the Autarch.

                            They have complete power over the laws of the city.
                            Their word is final.

                    <p>
                        The Praetariat is the disciplinary body in the city.
                        They are peacekeepers, and a warning against those that would seek to deface the Autarch or the city.
                        In many ways, they are the balance that keep all the other factions in check.
                        While there are Lightbearers in the ranks, the Pratariat focuses more on physical skill in combat.
                        They are also referred to as: "The Autarch's Right Hand".
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            Lowest Rank of the Pratariat.
                            Armed with a spear, they serve as the first line of defense in many situations.
                            Despite their low rank, they are fully trained and are able to best most non-Lightbearer combatants.

                            Captains are the next step above a traditional Guard, showing exemplary combat and/or leadership skills.
                            A traditional unit of the Praetariat consists of five individuals: four Guards, and a Captain.
                            Instead of a spear, Captains are armed with a pair of swords: a standard shortsword, and an estoc.
                            They are trained in both armed and unarmed combat.

                            There is one Commander per district, and are brought to the front lines only in case of emergency.
                            They are very deft in combat, able to go toe to toe with some Lightbearers.

                            Members of the Autarch's inner-circle.
                            There are only three Praetors, responsible for overseeing the entire military.
                            Any given Praetor has showcased mastery of both combat and strategy, and as such are some of the most difficult individuals to kill because of this.
                            Currently, there are two regular Praetors, and one Arch-Praetor (see: Special Ranks)

                            This does not override any current rank.
                            For example, Lightbearing members would be referred to as: Lancer Guard, Lancer Captain, Special Commander, and Arch Praetor respectively.
                            In terms of rank, a Lancer Guard technically outranks a regular Guard, but is still beneath a regular Captain.

                            While direct interference is rare, the Autarch outranks even the Arch Praetor, and as such their orders are final.

                    <p>
                        The Magistry is not under direct control of the Autarch, and therefore a third-party institution.
                        While technically a religious institution, the Magistry provides many services to the city, placing them firmly in a position of some power.
                        Their ability to produce powerful Lightbearers is a useful tool to many people, including both the Noble Houses and the Autarch.
                        Most members of the Magistry are nonbinary, believing this makes them more 'divine' and brings them closer to godliness.

                            Often used to supplement the Praetoriat, although they also have been used in several assassination plots regarding the nobility.

                    <p>
                        The Noble Houses provide various important economic services to the city.
                        While these positions are non-political, the resources they provide allow the City of Light to run, and as such, it's in the Autarch's best interest to keep them satisifed.
                        The Noble Houses are very cutthroat, with members desperate to secure as much power as they can, either by employing workers in the depths of the city, or trying to steal the positions of other houses.
                        Many assassinations have been enacted because of this, only few of which could be reasonably proven.

                    <p>
                        Due to the instrinsic nature of the Houses, each one follows a different structure, depending on the current leadership, and house size.
