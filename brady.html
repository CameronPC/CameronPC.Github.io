                        A victorian-style city set on the fulcrum of the world which stretches almost down to the core.
                        The bottom layers don't experience much light at all.
                        The city itself is massive in scale, more akin to an entire state than a city.
                        It has been built upon itself recursively due to limited space.
                        Stretching the bounds of physical space, Pale Barrens stunt the outward growth of the city.
                        The Pale Barrens themselves are a wasteland, scorched frequently by the celestic lights, while
                        just past that lies the edge of the world, where the sky touches ground.
                        Nobody has survived to see this far, however.

                        The City of Light sits directly center of the world, with the Pale Barrens at the extremes.
                        Due to it's massive size, the climate of the City of Light can change drastically depending on
                        location, both horizontal or vertical, however anywhere within the city is considered habitable
                        by humans.
                        The Pale Barrens existing outside of the city limits, while they hold many sought after
                        resources, also are terribly caustic, capable of inflicting physical harm on anyone stupid
                        enough to venture outwards.
                        Under direct sun/moonlight, an individual will begin to go through a process akin to 'melting'.
                        After approximately seven seconds of direct exposure, the individual will be effectively dead,
                        and will turn into a Dreg in tandum with the current celestial cycle.

                        The City of Light experiences day and night differently.
                        There are five varying suns and moons, which cycle through on a daily basis.
                        Weeks are five days long due to this fact.
                        Each celestial body has a unique appearance as well as special properties, both represented in
                        their light (see: Magic), and an associated mineral.
                        The celestial bodies are as follows:

                        A multitude of religions center around the celestial bodies, with the most prevelant being the
                        Magistry due to their close ties with city Nobility and their fiercesome Lightbearers.
                        None of these religions are explicitly true, though religions without belief in any of the
                        celestial bodies are usually considered taboo.
                        The reason for such ferverent belief is the ability for some individuals to wield light for
                        themselves. This process is known as Lightbearing (see: Magic).
                        A common belief is that each pair (a sun and a moon) are equal and opposites. This is also
                        expressed in Lightbearing.

                    <p class="description">
                        The main political system of that in the City of Light follows a monarch, known by the title of
                        'Autarch', and a series of noble houses.
                        The nobles houses are not determined by blood, but rather by financial standing; they provide
                        vital services to the city, such as lumber or stone.
                        A heavy system of political intrigue has set in an attempt to secure more power, with nobles
                        often hosting lavish parties or dueling enemies.
                        Generally, however, the assassination of a noble will be met with persecution by the Autarch and
                        the Praesidium, the city peacekeepers. This has only compelled the nobles to plot against each
                        other in secret
                        The Magistry is often used for mercenary work for the houses, and by the Autarch. Otherwise they
                        are a neutral third party, content with their power in the city.

                    <p class="description">
                        Lightbearing is a genetic ability in which an individual is able to absorb light from the
                        various celestial bodies and use it to gain supernatural abilities
                        Each celestial body grants a different ability; a notable trend is that a sun and moon will
                        provide abilities that are linked in some way.
                        The amount of light a user has stored is measured in what is known as a 'Lum'. Conversely, the
                        drain a given ability has on volume of light stored is what's called 'Dispersion Rate'.
                        Any given Lightbearer can store around 100 Lums before experiecing adverse effects, such as
                        melting.
                    </p>

                    <p class="description">
                        Furthermore, certain minerals can also store a charge of light, providing a means to store
                        different types of light.
                        The disperation rate, and volume of light a mineral is able to store is dependant on size and
                        mineral type.
                        A notable connection has been made between these minerals and a linking celestial body; there
                        are ten in total.
                    </p>

                    <p class="description pb-5">
                        It should be noted that Lightbearers have been unable to draw upon the power of Mysus or Axien.

                        In many ways, they are the balance that keep all the other factions in check.
                        While there are Lightbearers in the ranks, the Pratariat focuses more on physical skill in

                            Captain.
                            Instead of a spear, Captains are armed with a pair of swords: a standard shortsword, and an
                            estoc. A flintlock pistol is also used to bolster their arsenal.
                            They are trained in both armed and unarmed combat.

                            There are only three Praetors, responsible for overseeing the entire military.
                            Any given Praetor has showcased mastery of both combat and strategy, and as such are some of
                            the most difficult individuals to kill because of this.
                            Currently, there are two regular Praetors, and one Arch-Praetor (see: Special Ranks)

                            A designation given to Lightbearers in the Praetariat.
                            This does not override any current rank.
                            For example, Lightbearing members would be referred to as: Lancer Guard, Lancer Captain,
                            Special Commander, and Arch Praetor respectively.
                            In terms of rank, a Lancer Guard technically outranks a regular Guard, but is still beneath
                            a regular Captain.

                            their orders are final.

                        The Magistry is not under direct control of the Autarch, and therefore a third-party
                        institution.
                        While technically a religious institution, the Magistry provides many services to the city,
                        placing them firmly in a position of some power.
                        Their ability to produce powerful Lightbearers is a useful tool to many people, including both
                        the Noble Houses and the Autarch.
                        Most members of the Magistry are nonbinary, believing this makes them more 'divine' and brings
                        them closer to godliness.

                            Often used to supplement the Praetoriat, although they also have been used in several
                            assassination plots regarding the nobility.
                            Both the Noble Houses and the Magistry deny these claims.

                    <p class="description">
                        The Noble Houses provide various important economic services to the city.
                        While these positions are non-political, the resources they provide allow the City of Light to
                        run, and as such, it's in the Autarch's best interest to keep them satisifed.
                        The Noble Houses are very cutthroat, with members desperate to secure as much power as they can,
                        either by employing workers in the depths of the city, or trying to steal the positions of other
                        houses.
                        Many assassinations have been enacted because of this, only few of which could be reasonably
                        proven.

                    <p class="description">
                        Due to the instrinsic nature of the Houses, each one follows a different structure, depending on
                        the current leadership, and house size.
