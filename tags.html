                        <p>
                            We could start off with personal reasons as to why characters make stories great, but that would being a disservice to the craft.
                            Everyone has their likes and dislikes, and our personal reasons for liking characters are secondary to objective facts.
                            To put it in more succinct terms: liking a character doesn't mean they are a good or well-written character, and vice versa.
                        </p>

                        <div class="img-holder-right">

                            <p>Diagram of the Monomyth</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            There are two concepts you should know about before we go further.
                            First, is the monomyth, otherwise known as the Hero's Journey.
                            The Hero's Journey as a concept was first penned by Joseph Campbell in his book <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i>.
                            Heavily influenced by the psychologist Carl Jung (more on him in a second), Campbell used his book to try and find a narrative through line between various myths, stories, and religions.
                            The result was a seventeen stage pattern, split into three categories: Departure, Initiation, and Return.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Depictions of the monomyth usual vary, though almost always it is shown as a circle, like the one seen here.
                            You're probably at least familiar with some of the stages, such as the call to action.
                            Most of the other stages are rephrased frequently, like 'Belly of the Whale' also being referred to as the 'First Trial'.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Why this diagram- and the monomyth itself- is important when it comes to character is that the journey itself is an extension of the character's psyche.
                            The journey does not happen without the intervention of the hero, and therefore without a hero there is no journey.
                            Taking this idea further, when every character has the potential to be a hero (i.e the hero of their own story), the wealth and depth of a story rests entirely on its characters.

                        <h3>Jungian Archetypes</h3>
                        <div class="img-holder-left">
                            <img src="https://i0.wp.com/conorneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/12-major-personality-archetypes-diagram-vector-15945503-e1524338963211.jpg?resize=840%2C837&amp;ssl=1" alt="Understanding Personality: The 12 Jungian Archetypes – Moving People to  Action" height="400" width="400" style="float: right" />
                            <p>Diagram of the Twelve Archetypes</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            The second concept you should know about is Jungian Archetypes.
                            If you've taken a psychology class, chances are you'll recognize Carl Jung.
                            He's most famous for his hierarchy of needs, outlining basic human behavior at various stages of fufillment.
                            We're not here to talk about this today. Instead of pyramids, I want to focus on this big, beautiful, and very colorful circle.
                            These are the Jungian Archetypes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The Jungian Archetypes are twelve presets used to try and catagorize types of people.
                            I'm not talking about fictional people, I'm talking about real life humans.
                            Nowadays we just use it to describe fictional characters, which I'm completely fine with (frankly I like it better this way).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By viewing the table to the left you can get a basic gist of each archetype, though it should be noted that characters can fit into multiple archetypes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reason I bring this up is that most, if not all, good characters fit into at least one of these archetypes.
                            Most of the time the author doesn't even bother to think of this chart, if at all.
                            Still, any good character will fall here, either intentionally or unintentionally.
                        </p>
