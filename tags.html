                                We could start off with personal reasons as to why characters make stories great, but
                                that would being a disservice to the craft.
                                Everyone has their likes and dislikes, and our personal reasons for liking characters
                                are secondary to objective facts.
                                To put it in more succinct terms: liking a character doesn't mean they are a good or
                                well-written character, and vice versa.

                            </div>

                            <p>
                                There are two concepts you should know about before we go further.
                                First, is the monomyth, otherwise known as the Hero's Journey.
                                The Hero's Journey as a concept was first penned by Joseph Campbell in his book <i>The
                                    Hero with a Thousand Faces</i>.
                                Heavily influenced by the psychologist Carl Jung (more on him in a second), Campbell
                                used his book to try and find a narrative through line between various myths, stories,
                                and religions.
                                The result was a seventeen stage pattern, split into three categories: Departure,
                                Initiation, and Return.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Depictions of the monomyth usual vary, though almost always it is shown as a circle,
                                like the one seen here.
                                You're probably at least familiar with some of the stages, such as the call to action.
                                Most of the other stages are rephrased frequently, like 'Belly of the Whale' also being
                                referred to as the 'First Trial'.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Why this diagram- and the monomyth itself- is important when it comes to character is
                                that the journey itself is an extension of the character's psyche.
                                The journey does not happen without the intervention of the hero, and therefore without
                                a hero there is no journey.
                                Taking this idea further, when every character has the potential to be a hero (i.e the
                                hero of their own story), the wealth and depth of a story rests entirely on its
                                characters.
                            </p>

                                    The second concept you should know about is Jungian Archetypes.
                                    If you've taken a psychology class, chances are you'll recognize Carl Jung.
                                    He's most famous for his hierarchy of needs, outlining basic human behavior at
                                    various stages of fufillment.
                                    We're not here to talk about this today. Instead of pyramids, I want to focus on
                                    this big, beautiful, and very colorful circle.
                                    These are the Jungian Archetypes.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The Jungian Archetypes are twelve presets used to try and catagorize types of
                                    people.
                                    I'm not talking about fictional people, I'm talking about real life humans.
                                    Nowadays we just use it to describe fictional characters, which I'm completely fine
                                    with (frankly I like it better this way).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    By viewing the table to the left you can get a basic gist of each archetype, though
                                    it should be noted that characters can fit into multiple archetypes.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The reason I bring this up is that most, if not all, good characters fit into at
                                    least one of these archetypes.
                                    Most of the time the author doesn't even bother to think of this chart, if at all.
                                    Still, any good character will fall here, either intentionally or unintentionally.

                                Characters take up the most important role that go into story telling in my opinion.
                                They help to convey plot points, and give the players/readers people to either attach to
                                or through their hatred at.
                                Characters need to be someone enjoyable for the players, so long as that character is
                                not intent on being against the players.
                                Players can have a dislike for good characters, but then the point of the character in
                                the future should be to flesh them out, and make them somewhat better for the players.
                                Characters are the most fun for me to make as I get to go a bit wild with personalities
                                when I want to, which is the most fun part as a DM.

                                A character above all else has to be relatable.
                                Not necessarily by action or emotions but through their interactions between the rest of
                                the story.
                                The Joker is a very beloved villain, not because most people would like to partake in
                                his actions, rather he is a villain that embodies a side a us we can replicate, pure
                                unadulterated insanity.
                                That's why as we grow up, we tend to idolize the hero less.
                                Many heroes are not easily projectable for us.
                                Villains tend to do actions that we couldn't do ourselves.
                                So, the most popular characters are ones that project a side of ourselves we rather not
                                live out, a side that has something we don't have.

                                Characters are an essential part to any good story.
                                Personally, even if a story has a great narrative plot and an incredible setting, if the
                                characters are too one-dimensional, the whole thing falls apart. A good character in my
                                opinion has to seem like a real person.
                                People are complicated, and that's what makes creating a really good character difficult
                                at times.
                                Everyone has their own unique background, personality, and set of life experiences that
                                influence how they might respond to given situations, and future events can further
                                change their views and responses to other situations.
                                Rather than making worlds of my own, I spend far more time making characters for other
                                people's worlds, and so the process of fleshing out a character and making them seem
                                like a living, breathing person is a process I have come to deeply understand, and
                                greatly appreciate when I see it done well by other people.

                                    Professor Ellertson often likes to talk about how we're the future and the makers of
                                    our own realities; at least something similar.
                                    At least in the fictional sense of this concept, I agree.
                                    My personal approach to characters is that a good character shouldn't be forced down
                                    a path.
                                    I give them traits, and personalities, and usually let that determine the road they
                                    travel.
                                    While adhering to a looser approach to storytelling does have its cons, this also
                                    leads to more natural characters and stories.
