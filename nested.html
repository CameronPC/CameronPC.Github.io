                        <p>Magic and the type of technology that goes into a world can be some of the most memorable portion of whatever world you look into. 
                            For example; when you think of Avatar the Last Airbender, the first thought in your mind is probably the bending, aka that world's version
                            of magic. When you think of One Piece one of the most prominenet features of that world is the devil fruit, and haki that people have, 
                            which again are that world's "magic". For worlds without magic or anything of the sort we usually have a certain technological age they may 
                            be in. For example, Cyberpunk 2077, a game without magic, but time period is so advanced that the technology is extremely futuristic, and 
                            it is one of the big ideas when you think of the game.</p>

                        <h4>Myles's Thoughts:</h4>
                        <p>It's not uncommon to have open debates on the internet about what fantasy power system is the best, devil fruits from One Piece vs Nen from Hunter X Hunter. a good magic/power or technology system should be able to feel like its own unique power system but not so abstract that it disassociates from other powers. a system should find that balance it a way that is uniquely its own.</p>

                        <h4>Ryker's Thoughts:</h4>
                        <p>One of my favorite things to learn about when it comes to fictional worlds are the magic or technological systems that the world runs on. If a fictional world has a really unique and intricate magic system, or the creator has taken the time to describe how their form of technology works, it tells me that the creator of this fictional world really took the time to develope even the smaller details of their world.</p>
