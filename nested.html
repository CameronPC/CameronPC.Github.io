                                some of the most memorable
                                portion of whatever world you look into.
                                For example; when you think of Avatar the Last Airbender, the first thought in your mind
                                is probably the bending, aka that world's version
                                of magic. When you think of One Piece one of the most prominenet features of that world
                                is the devil fruit, and haki that people have,
                                which again are that world's "magic". For worlds without magic or anything of the sort
                                we usually have a certain technological age they may
                                be in. For example, Cyberpunk 2077, a game without magic, but time period is so advanced
                                that the technology is extremely futuristic, and
                                it is one of the big ideas when you think of the game.</p>

                            <p class="description pb-3">It's not uncommon to have open debates on the internet about
                                what fantasy power system is
                                the best, devil fruits from One Piece vs Nen from Hunter X Hunter. a good magic/power or
                                technology system should be able to feel like its own unique power system but not so
                                abstract that it disassociates from other powers. a system should find that balance it a
                                way that is uniquely its own.</p>

                            <p class="description pb-3">One of my favorite things to learn about when it comes to
                                fictional worlds are the magic
                                or technological systems that the world runs on. If a fictional world has a really
                                unique and intricate magic system, or the creator has taken the time to describe how
                                their form of technology works, it tells me that the creator of this fictional world
                                really took the time to develope even the smaller details of their world.</p>

                            <p class="descritpion pb-3">Magic isn't defined by what it can do, but rather what it can't.
                                A story in which
                                anything is possible is largely less interesting than a story where there a limits, and
                                the characters have to be smart to work around them. This also helps increase tension.
                                It removes a lot of uncertainty if somone can wave their hands and simply get rid of all
                                their problems; it's a lot more compelling if a character has to rely on their brain for
                                a creative way to solve a problem with their given tools; magic.</p>
