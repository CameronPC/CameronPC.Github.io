    <h1 class="centertext">This page is about me... I think...</h1>

    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I am a Gimm student who mainly cares for the more artistic side of things of making games. <br>
    I enjoy laying games, and drawing in my free time, as well as hanging with friends and playing <br>
    Dnd with large parties. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: right;">Shows I like to watch:</h2>
    <p style="text-align: right;">Some of my favorite shows are animes, which I've been binging a lot while I do my school work.<br>
    My faovrite anime at the moment would probably be One Piece, but I've got some other close ones<br>
    such as Mob Psycho, Demon Slayer, and Hunter x Hunter, just to name a few.</p>
