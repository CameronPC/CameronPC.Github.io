                        <h2>My Expirience with Icewind Dale</h2>
                        <img class="camImages" src="Personal Website (Cam)/IcewindDaleCover.png" />
                        <p>In one of my DnD cmapaigns I had decided to run the campaign Icewind Dale, a campaign based
                            around a frozen wasteland
                            in which many residents still inhabit. I used the maps given to me (and added a few of my
                            own)
                            but generally the idea
                            of the world, aka icewind dale, stayed the same. I ended up adding in my own characters and
                            plot
                            ideas to more make the
                            campaign my own, and help it to fit my players ideals and what they wanted to do. Recently I
                            had
                            taken a break to make
                            a large section of the campaign be made completley by myelf, story wise atleast. Basically,
                            I've
                            found a map of a city,
                            images of for npcs, and fully created a new storyline to follow. The rest of this page will
                            be
                            going over mainly those
                            new portions that I have added.

                        <h2>The City of Agrona</h2>
                        <img class="camImages" id="agronaMap" src="Personal Website (Cam)/Argo dispo neo2.png" />
                        <p>This is the city of Agrona, I used a map I found through a patreon I pay for, and decided I
                            liked
                            it, and wanted to
                            incorporate it into my campaign. The city is a large city that flies about Icewind Dale, and
                            is
                            far more technologically
                            advanced than almost anywhere else in Icewind Dale. This map details 4 quadrants each with
                            multiple districts within,
                            this allows the players to have a wide sandbox to mess around in, and explore for
                            themselves. I
                            have many new locations
                            implemented into this city, from sewers systems, to hotels, to other secrets the players
                            have
                            yet to find, so I'm not
                            really allowed to reveal them at the moment. I myself am not a very good map maker, so I
                            find
                            maps I like on the internet,
                            and go on using them from there.

                        <h2>Some of the Know NPCs of Agrona</h2>
                        <img class="camImages" id="bragon" src="Personal Website (Cam)/Bragon" />
                        <p>Bragon</p>

                        <p>Papa Charles</p>
                        <p>These are all some of the more notable npcs that the characters have interacted with so far.
                            For
                            my characters, I usually
                            don't have the time to create all npc art myself, so I use pinterest primarily to find
                            images of
                            already create images that
                            I like, and I use those, and adapt backstories, and personalities around them, some fit
                            better
                            than others, but I try to not
                            stray miles from how the character looks, and what their personality may be. I really enjoy
                            making new npcs, specifically ones
                            I believe the players may latch onto, as it gives them more npcs to talk to and find out
                            more
                            and more about their where abouts.

                        <img class="camImages" id="bragon"
                            src="Personal Website (Cam)/su-jeong-ahn-airship-station-fin.jpg" />
                        <p>My favorite technology setting to base my campaigns around is the steampunk era. I find the
                            idea
                            of steampunk to be very interesting
                            as well as it allows me to think of fun creations/weapons to make, either for my own ideas,
                            or
                            for the players. The magic systems I
                            use are very basic dnd based magic, I usally allow baseline rules, and homebrew as long as
                            it's
                            all approved by me before hand.
