                    <h2>My Expirience with Icewind Dale</h2>
                    <img class="camImages" src="Personal Website (Cam)/IcewindDaleCover.png" />
                    <p>In one of my DnD cmapaigns I had decided to run the campaign Icewind Dale, a campaign based around a frozen wasteland
                        in which many residents still inhabit. I used the maps given to me (and added a few of my own) but generally the idea
                        of the world, aka icewind dale, stayed the same. I ended up adding in my own characters and plot ideas to more make the
                        campaign my own, and help it to fit my players ideals and what they wanted to do. Recently I had taken a break to make 
                        a large section of the campaign be made completley by myelf, story wise atleast. Basically, I've found a map of a city,
                        images of for npcs, and fully created a new storyline to follow. The rest of this page will be going over mainly those
                        new portions that I have added.

                    <h2>The City of Agrona</h2>
                    <img class="camImages" id="agronaMap" src="Personal Website (Cam)/Argo dispo neo2.png" />
                    <p>This is the city of Agrona, I used a map I found through a patreon I pay for, and decided I liked it, and wanted to
                        incorporate it into my campaign. The city is a large city that flies about Icewind Dale, and is far more technologically 
                        advanced than almost anywhere else in Icewind Dale. This map details 4 quadrants each with multiple districts within,
                        this allows the players to have a wide sandbox to mess around in, and explore for themselves. I have many new locations
                        implemented into this city, from sewers systems, to hotels, to other secrets the players have yet to find, so I'm not
                        really allowed to reveal them at the moment. I myself am not a very good map maker, so I find maps I like on the internet,
                        and go on using them from there.

                    <h2>Some of the Know NPCs of Agrona</h2>
                    <img class="camImages" id="bragon" src="Personal Website (Cam)/Bragon" />
                    <p>Bragon</p>

                    <p>Lance</p>

                    <p>Papa Charles</p>
                    <p>These are all some of the more notable npcs that the characters have interacted with so far. For my characters, I usually
                        don't have the time to create all npc art myself, so I use pinterest primarily to find images of already create images that
                        I like, and I use those, and adapt backstories, and personalities around them, some fit better than others, but I try to not
                        stray miles from how the character looks, and what their personality may be. I really enjoy making new npcs, specifically ones
                        I believe the players may latch onto, as it gives them more npcs to talk to and find out more and more about their where abouts.

                    <h2>The Technology</h2>
                    <img class="camImages" id="bragon" src="Personal Website (Cam)/su-jeong-ahn-airship-station-fin.jpg" />
                    <p>My favorite technology setting to base my campaigns around is the steampunk era. I find the idea of steampunk to be very interesting
                        as well as it allows me to think of fun creations/weapons to make, either for my own ideas, or for the players. The magic systems I
                        use are very basic dnd based magic, I usally allow baseline rules, and homebrew as long as it's all approved by me before hand.
