                            Setting up a good world
                            for your players or reader can be so vitally important because it will also set up
                            everything else to come, the type of people, the technology, the time period, it all banks
                            on setting of your choosing. You can also use the setting to better implement a story, for
                            instance a barbarian based story might not work as well in a futuristic setting, it would be
                            interesting, but could work best in an olden time based setting.</p>

                        <h4 class="title">Myles' thoughts:</h4>
                        <p class="description pb-3">I think that a key part of good story is the setting. My favorite
                            settings are ones that
                            create plot points or ideas to be later utilized. the more the setting utilizes Chekov's gun
                            the more the story progresses. Regardless of genre, setting up some sort of background for
                            everything to come allows for the story to flow more naturally.</p>

                        <p class="description pb-3">The setting of a fictional world is almost as important to me as the
                            characters. A story
                            could have the greatest characters ever written but, admittedly, if I don't find the setting
                            of the world intriguing, I might never read/experience that story. I think a fictional
                            world's history or "lore" also plays an important part in making a good setting, and if that
                            history can be incorporated into the main plot of a story, I think it can create an
                            incredible start to a powerful story.</p>

                        <p class="description pb-3">The foundation of any story. A setting is often the first impression
                            any
                            one gets of a world. It's not entirely disimilar to a book cover. It doesn't have to be
                            flashy, but it is what draws people in. Setting done well can enhance tone, themes, or
                            motifs in a story, and reflect the characters within it. Understanding your setting and why
                            things behave as they do is important, as most often the setting determines the rules of
                            your universe, and if there's one universal law of storytelling, it's to never, <i>ever</i>
                            break rules you've established. You fail to uphold your laws, and the validity of the whole
                            world is brought into question.</p>
